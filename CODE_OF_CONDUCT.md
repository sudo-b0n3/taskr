# Taskr Community Guidelines

We keep Taskr friendly and collaborative. By contributing, you agree to:

- Treat everyone with respect. Assume good intent, stay constructive, and avoid personal attacks.
- Keep communication professional. No harassment, discrimination, or inappropriate content.
- Respect privacy. Do not share anyone's private information without consent.
- Flag issues early. If something feels off, let the maintainers know so we can sort it out quickly.

Project maintainers may edit or remove contributions that violate these guidelines and may temporarily or permanently limit participation if problems persist.
